# Professional Portfolio

## Purpose

The assignment was to creat a professional portfolio from scretch. This portfolio is a template that I will at some point showcase all my skills that I've learned throughout the several weeks at UConn Coding Boot Camp. This assignment was a bit challenging since it was my first from scretch but since I did the Run Buddy challenge before this assignment I had great understanding were to begin. I've learned that a wireframe design is very important before actually getting  any coding done. This served as my script in designing this portfolio.
